# Cells: The building blocks of life

![[Pasted image 20230902120540.png]]

- Cells are the fundamental units of life (living units)
- All organisms are built from cells
	- Unicellular organisms to multicellular organisms
	- All cells share similar properties
		- Chemistry
		- Genetics
		- Energy production
		- Evolution from a common ancestor
	- Two types of organism
		- **Prokaryotic** - no cell nucleus (they have a nucleoid)
		- **Eukaryotic** - has a cell nucleus
		  
		- Both have DNA
- Cells come in many different shapes and sizes
	- A. Neuron from a mammalian brain
		- ![1](assets/attachments/89cce57c-0022-448e-a5fb-296175ec8599.PNG)
	- B. Paramecium - giant, single celled organism
		- ![](assets/attachments/89cce57c-0022-448e-a5fb-296175ec8599.PNG)
	- C. Chlamydomonas - algae
		- ![[Pasted image 20230902121127.png]]
	- D. Saccharomyces cerevisiae - yeast
		- ![[Pasted image 20230902121659.png]]
	- E. Helicobacter pylori - bacterium that causes stomach ulcers
		- a prokaryote
		- ![[Pasted image 20230902121817.png]]
- All Living cells have similar needs and chemistry
	- They need energy
	- They have waste products
	- They carry a genetic code (DNA)
	- They can reproduce/replicate
	- Organelles are the intracellular structures that perform all of these functions (and more)
	- They have a barrier between the outside world and the cellular components... the cell membrane

## The Cell

### Eukaryotic animal cell

	![[Pasted image 20230902130219.png]]

- The organelles are a series of internal structures within a cell
- They are responsible for all the cellular functions including:
	- Protein production
		- e.g. Extracellular matrix production, hormone and steroid production
	- Energy production
		- Respiration
	- Cell to cell signalling
		- Organ/cellular function.. e.g. neural signalling via neurotransmitter release
	- Waste processing

### Organelles
- - "mini organs"
	- Nucleus
		- Nucleolus
	- Ribosomes
	- Endoplasmic Reticulum
		- Rough and smooth
	- Centrioles
	- Mitochondria
	- Lysosomes + Peroxisomes
	- Golgi apparatus
- All have different functions within the cell

## The Cell Membrane
### Plasma Membrane

- The plasma membrane contains all the components of the cell (outer skin)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230902130433.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20230902130524.png]]

- Comprised of lipid molecules arranged with their hydrophilic head facing outwards and their hydrophobic tails facing inwards
	- Hydro<u>philic</u> - water loving
	- Hydro<u>phobic</u> - water hating
- It's a **BILAYER**
- The membrane houses various proteins
	- Transmembrane
	- Integral - inside facing
- Cell receptors are transmembrane proteins that bind molecules on the outside of the cells and can induce a signalling cascade on the inside of the cell
- Protein channels can regulate the flow of ions and proteins inside and outside of the cell
- The process of signalling across the membrane is called **SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION**

## Organelles: Nucleus

>![[Pasted image 20230904093410.png]]

- Nucleus contains DNA plus other molecules mainly involved in DNA replication and RNA synthesis
- It is surrounded by a membrane - the nuclear envelope/membrane
	- The membrane contains pores (nucleopores) that let small molecules (including RNA) in and out of the nucleus
- The DNA sits within the nucleus but there is also a "nucleolus" within the nucleus

## Recap

>![[Pasted image 20230904093501.png]]

- Cell surrounded by plasma membrane
	- Lipid bilayer
	- Contains various proteins and lipids
	- Receptors are transmembrane proteins that signal between the outside and inside of the cell in a process called signal transduction
- The cell contains organelles that all have different functions
	- **Nucleus:**
		- Contains the DNA (genetic matter) plus other enzymes and proteins responsible for DNA replication and synthesis of RNA
	- Also contains the nucleolus, an area of the nucleus where ribosomes are made

# Nuclear DNA
## Genetic material

![[Pasted image 20230906141822.png]]

- DNA can be replicated
	- Necessary for cells to divide and pass on their genetic material from cell to cell
	- DNA <u>polymerase</u> 
- DNA encodes genes
	- Segments of DNA that contain the instructions for proteins
	- The human genome has ~20,000 - 25,000 genes
	- The number of genes does not correlate with the complexity of the organism (rice has about 50,000 genes)

# DNA & Chromosomes 
<u>D</d>oxyribo<u>n</u>ucleic <u>a</u>cid

![[Pasted image 20230906144820.png]]
- The heritable genetic material that encode most of the genes in an organism
- Contained within the nucleus
- Essentially a polymer, made up of 4 different monomer units (nucleotides)
	- ![[Pasted image 20230906142245.png]]
	- <u>A</u>denine
	- <u>T</u>hymine
	- <u>G</u>uanine
	- <u>C</u>ytosine
- Exists in a condensed (compressed) state
- Wrapped around proteins called <u>histones</u> to form nucleosomes
	- Histones help regulate access to the genes.
- Condensed further to become chromosomes
- These components unravel when access to particular genes is required (e.g. to make a RNA copy)
- A single DNA strand exists as in a DOUBLE HELIX arrangement.
- Two single strands of DNA joined together
	- "Base pairing"
	- Hydrogen bonds
	- The correct base complement must be on both strands for double stranded DNA to form
		- ![[Pasted image 20230906145620.png]]
		- G's with C's
		- T's with A's

# RNA & Proteins
<u>R</u>ibo<u>n</u>ucleic <u>a</u>cid

![[Pasted image 20230906150018.png]]
- A copy of DNA (i.e. the genes)
- Synthesized from DNA in the nucleus by a process we call **transcription** (RNA polymerase)
- Has a few fundamental differences from DNA
	- Single stranded
	- Has <u>u</u>racil in place of <u>t</u>hymine
	- Has a tail of adenines on the end (polyadenylation)
- RNA essentially contains the instructions to make a **protein**
- The ribosome then translates the code on the RNA to form a protein chain (**Translation**)

# Recap: DNA, RNA and Protein synthesis

![[Pasted image 20230906150842.png]]

- DNA contains the genetic code "genes"
- Genes are <u>transcribed</u> into RNA
- RNA is <u>translated</u> into proteins by **ribosomes**
# Organelles
"mini organs"

![[Pasted image 20230906173401.png]]

- Plasma membrane (NOT an organelle)
- Many organelles have their own membrane systems
- Nucleus
	- DNA
	- RNA
- Ribosomes
- Endoplasmic Reticulum
	- **Smooth** and **rough**
	- Metabolic synthesis, protein synthesis and modifications
- Mitochondria 
	- Metabolic pathways
	- The powerhouse of the cell (ATP production)

## The Cell

![[Pasted image 20230906174132.png]]

Organelles
- Nucleus
	- Nucleolus
- Ribosomes
- Endoplasmic Reticulum
	- Rough and smooth
- Centrioles
- Mitochondria
- Lysosomes a peroxisomes
- Golgi apparatus
All have different functions in the cell

## Ribosomes

![[Pasted image 20230906174458.png]]

- Synthesized by nucleolus (nucleus) and reside in the cytoplasm of the cell
- Responsible for protein synthesis 
	- mRNA is a template for protein synthesis
	- Ribosomes read the mRNA template and assemble a protein chain from amino acids (**Translation**)
- Can be free in the cytoplasm of the cell or bound to the endoplasmic reticulum
	- Starts protein synthesis free in the cytosol
	- Moves to the ER where the proteins continue to be synthesized before they get released into the ER for further modification

## Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)

![[Pasted image 20230906180155.png]]

- Consists of a continuous internal membrane that forms a series of flattened sacks

![[Pasted image 20230906180859.png]]

- **Smooth**
	- <u>Responsible for the creation and storage of various lipids (for membranes etc..) and steroids</u>
- **Rough**
	- <u>Responsible for synthesis and packaging of proteins</u>
	- Studded with ribosomes
		- Messenger RNA (mRNA) makes its way from the nucleus to a ribosome on the outside of the ER and then the ribosome builds the protein chain from the transcript
		- The protein then moves into the ER where it is further modified before it gets sent out into the cytoplasm of the cell or to the golgi apparatus

## Golgi Apparatus
The "post office" of the cell

- Similar to the ER in its structure
- Transports, modifies and packages proteins for delivery out of the cell OR to the plasma membrane
	-  Packages proteins in secretory vesicles
	- Also packages lipids, steroids and other molecules.

- Exocytosis ![[Pasted image 20230906180823.png]]
	- Active transport of molecules and proteins **out** of the cell
	- The vessels released from the golgi fuse with the plasma membrane and release their cargo
	- Can occur in a regulated or unregulated manner
	- Used to move membrane bound proteins (receptors) after being synthesized
	- Intracellular proteins generally don't go through the golgi system

![[Pasted image 20230906180918.png]]


## Mitochondria

![[Pasted image 20230906181950.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230906182023.png]]
- Has a **double membrane** where a POTENTIAL across the membrane drives the synthesis of ATP
	- Proton gradient
- Energy production
- Oxidative metabolism
	- Driven by a protein gradient
	- ATP
- The powerhouse of the cell
	- Responsible for oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production
		- Oxygen is needed to generate the proton gradient
			- Drives ATP production from ADP
			- ![[Pasted image 20230906182104.png]]

## Lysosomes and Peroxisomes



- A form of intracellular defense
- ![[Pasted image 20230906182511.png|258]]

- Lysosomes 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230906182444.png]]
