In conclusion, the experiments were largely successful as the group was able to accurately dispense varying volumes of liquids as shown by the tables in the results section under part 2.4, there was one occasion where liquid may have either been inaccurately dispensed or accidentally dispensed twice however we have reflected on that and learnt from it.
We have also been able to observe the change in absorbance levels in relation to concentrations using the Bradford Protein Assay and were able to visibly inspect the change in colour of the sample whilst also learning how to operate the spectrophotometer.

The experiments have introduced us to assays as well as liquid handling as a whole which will undoubtedly prove to be useful in future labs and external applications. The group was also able to demonstrate communication as well as accuracy and repeatability in using newly introduced lab equipment. 
Our findings and experiences throughout the experiment also highlighted the importance of proper time and equipment management which will guide us to perform future labs more efficiently allow us to aim for less rushed results, hopefully leading to greater accuracy in our findings.
